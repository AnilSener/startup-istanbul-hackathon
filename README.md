## Description

[![Koding Hackathon](https://github.com/koding/hackathon.submit/raw/master/images/badge.png?raw=true "Koding Hackathon")](https://koding.com/Hackathon)


The Pursuit of Happiness is defined as a fundamental right mentioned in the Declaration of Independence. We believe that the ultimate problem in the world is the lack of happiness. Thus, we decided to measure happiness by a Real-time Global Happiness Index. We created an interactive visualisation of happiness around the world using state of the art Deep Learning based Natural Language Processing algorithms tracking hourly Twitter Sentiment by country.

## Technology
We used Twitter API, NodeJS and MongoDB to collect hourly tweets from 162 countries around the world. We tried and compared all of the sentiment analysis API's in Mashape.com. Because of the limitations of the free tier API's we ended up developing and depoying our own Sentiment Analysis (powered by Stanford CoreNLP library) REST service on nginx server. We used Raphael and custom CSS/JS for visualization.

## Screenshots from Development
We had an Online-Offline mixed experience during this Hackathon. For offline meetings we used our local Starbucks and for online sessions ve used Koding, Join.me, TeamViewer, Skype, Gmail and even Facebook.
